# Utilities Guide

The [`src/util/`](mdc:src/util) directory contains utility modules and helpers used throughout the project.

- [`request.ts`](mdc:src/util/request.ts): Centralized API request handler using Axios, with built-in error handling and token management.
- [`utils.tsx`](mdc:src/util/utils.tsx): General-purpose utility functions for formatting, date handling, query parsing, and more.
- Other files provide specialized helpers (e.g., [`local.ts`](mdc:src/util/local.ts) for local storage, [`Socket.ts`](mdc:src/util/Socket.ts) for socket connections).

Utilities are imported as needed in services, components, and models to promote code reuse and consistency.
