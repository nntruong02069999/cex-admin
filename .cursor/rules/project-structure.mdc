# Project Structure Guide

The main source code is located in the [`src/`](mdc:src) directory, which contains the following key subdirectories:

- [`components/`](mdc:src/components): Reusable UI components, organized by feature or type.
- [`containers/`](mdc:src/containers): Container components and layout-related logic.
- [`routes/`](mdc:src/routes): Application route definitions and route-specific components.
- [`services/`](mdc:src/services): Service modules for API calls and business logic.
- [`util/`](mdc:src/util): Utility functions and helpers.
- [`models/`](mdc:src/models): Data models and types.
- [`constants/`](mdc:src/constants): Application-wide constants.
- [`styles/`](mdc:src/styles): Global and modular style files.
- [`assets/`](mdc:src/assets): Static assets such as images and fonts.

The main entry point for the application is [`src/index.tsx`](mdc:src/index.tsx).

Configuration files such as [`package.json`](mdc:package.json), [`tsconfig.json`](mdc:tsconfig.json), and [`README.md`](mdc:README.md) are located in the project root.
