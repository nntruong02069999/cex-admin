# Components Organization Guide

The [`src/components/`](mdc:src/components) directory contains reusable UI components, organized by feature or type (e.g., [`mail/`](mdc:src/components/mail), [`dashboard/`](mdc:src/components/dashboard)).

Each feature directory contains related components (e.g., [`Compose/`](mdc:src/components/mail/Compose), [`Listing/`](mdc:src/components/dashboard/Listing)). Components are typically implemented as React function or class components, and may import styles, utilities, or constants as needed.

Components are imported and used in containers, routes, or other components to build the application's UI.
